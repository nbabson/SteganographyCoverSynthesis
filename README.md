# SteganographyCoverSynthesis

June 2016
"createCover.c" embeds a message in a .ppm CA file
"recoverMessage.c" retrieves the message from a .ppm CA file

"exampleRule.txt" is the rule for a 4 state, neighborhood 7 CA that
has been evolved by the "CA.cpp" program to have interesting features.

4 KB of information can be stored in a 4 state neighborhood 7 CA.
I mean to include implementation for 8 state CAs, but that is not 
done at this time.
